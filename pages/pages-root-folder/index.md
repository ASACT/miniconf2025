The development of drugs for diseases with unmet medical needs remains a critical challenge in the pharmaceutical industry. Traditional randomized controlled trials (RCTs), while the gold standard, are often constrained by operational and ethical considerations, thereby creating a growing demand for complex innovative designs (CIDs) that can accelerate drug development without compromising safety and efficacy. Accordingly, CIDs - including master protocols and external controls - have garnered increased attention from industry, regulatory agencies and academia.
